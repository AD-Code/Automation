# Staff Developer Advocate, Nutanix Engineering
## Job Summary
Want to get in on the ground floor of a brand new global team? Nutanix is starting a Developer Advocacy practice and is looking to hire an experienced, top notch resource to help build the foundations. This team will be like no other at Nutanix and a successful candidate will be empowered to shape the future of this group. This team will report in through Engineering and will act as a bridge between outside developers and Nutanix as a whole. 

The initial mission of the Nutanix Developer Advocacy program is to win the hearts and minds of Developers and IT Operators by supporting them when interacting with the Nutanix suite of products. We want developers to keep using the ecosystems, languages, frameworks, and tools they already know and love, adding Nutanix flavors where it makes sense. 

## Job Description
Our initial idea to accomplish our mission is to build up a practice around the following ideals below, which is no means a prescriptive list. 

An ideal candidate will help review and build structure where it makes sense, and punt where it doesn’t make sense. An ideal candidate will also Define, Collaborate, Delegate, and Scale: There is no way one person can do everything we described below in one swing, so you’ll be responsible for defining importance, owning outcomes where practical, collaborating with others to maximize impact, delegating when needed, and work on function scalability when direct delegating is not possible.

### Potential Responsibilities 
* Say the word Developers more than Steve Balmer. A successful candidate will be passionate about being the voice of the user, will do everything with the needs of the developer in mind, and always keep the developer needs and culture front and center for both external and internal developers. 
* Be the beacons for Open Source culture at Nutanix. 
* Have FUN. We believe a successful candidate will be able to interact with the community in an interesting and engaging way, to both garner interest as well as cultivate community champions, with the overall goal of improving products via feedback, pull requests or otherwise.
* Encourage involvement at all levels, perhaps inviting first timers to contribute small/trivial changes to dip their toes in.
* Interact with the community both in person at meetups and conferences and online via various user communities, including Q&A sites, Twitter, and Slack.
* Keep the community up to date on new features, changes, and other bits that would impact them, possibly by hosting periodic webinars in addition to other content outlets
* Resist burnout. We’re not looking for someone to work 120 hours a week, because, well, thats insane. We want someone who gets the job done, has fun, helps us improve and scale, and focuses on amplifying their impact through efficiency, not someone who can rack up the most hours on a timecard or frequent flier miles. 
* Gather feedback in a way internal developers, who are directly adjacent to the code base, simply can’t, then use that feedback to shape our products and engineering strategy
* Prolifically produce useful, reusable content in formats that developers love. This will (likely) include contributing/refining product documentation, reimagining developer documentation, and creating interesting blog posts, YouTube videos, sample applications, code snippets, presentations, recorded live coding workshops, demos, and more. Open source everything where possible.
* Scale at the source where possible AND practical. If unblocking a developer means fixing the source code, do it. If it means producing content mentioned above, that works too. If we can parlay the two, by including code samples directly IN our API contracts / developer documentation or (for instance) enhancing auto generation of examples, thats a rising tide that will lift all boats.
* Passion for squashing bugs, not just through reports, but through detailed reproductions, code samples, and possible/practical solutions that would make 3rd party development easier, so internal developers can get down to fixing right off, and external developers can know that their problems are fully covered
* Productize tribal knowledge whenever possible, so all content is as accessible and demystified as possible
* Empower the community by hosting/attending/participating in conferences and other developer community events, like hackathons, code dojos, and mentoring. This (probably) includes non-trivial amounts of public speaking, both internally and externally. Ultimately, this is about building digestible narratives that developers both new and old can use to understand a topic, and having them be able to walk away having a deeper understanding than they had before.
* Love and embrace Learning: A successful candidate will spent a non-trivial amount of time learning new things, both internally and externally, for the ultimate benefit of the user, including learning right beside users as bleeding edge technologies come out. We think this could be 20-50% of the time, and envision that the product of this learning will result in reusable, digestible content.
* Amplify empathy, by translating real user pain and friction into a force for simplification or enhancements. You’ll have direct lines into both product management and core product engineering to be able to affect change.
* Better others and always empower people to be their best. Participate in both internal and external code reviews. Contribute code to GitHub and other OSS repositories no matter whom they belong to, so long as it benefits our developer community. Know when a product is or isn’t easy to use and know (or have a good idea) on how to fix it. Suggest fixes, be humble with feedback, and be hungry for change. 
* Make it easy to try our products. Collaborate with external facing teams to expose functional demos, focusing on “1 click simplicity” where possible
* Be obsessed with the front line, both inside the company and outside the company. Talk to both our developer communities as well as our front line technical engineers on what experiences they are having.
* Be a builder. If a solution doesn’t exist, propose it or build it yourself. 
* Be vocal, and be kind and humble in both giving and receiving feedback. 
* Be tenacious and always drive forward where possible. Kick down doors if you have to.
* Always close the loop both internally and externally
* Bring Nutanix’s .Heart program to the developer community. Give back and do good by mentoring students, support women in technology, advocate for diversity and inclusion for developers around the globe and champion good causes
* Form/propose KPIs for the group. Be data driven, automate wherever possible, and wrap measurement around everything, including content adoption
* Be honest: get the community excited about current and potential solutions, but also let them know when it may or may not fit their need(s), so they can focus on providing business value to their own organization/customers.  
* Cultivate and embolden trust between 3rd party party developers and internal product teams any means, including reaching across the table, listening, being clear, highlighting things that might have otherwise gone unnoticed, trying things yourself, and paving roads where there are none, and (sometimes) forcing ourselves to be in the developers shoes. This includes advocating for “Drinking Our Own Champaign” whenever and wherever possible, and commit as much internal content upstream as possible.
* Be as transparent to the community as legally possible
* Speaking of which, collaborate with our in-house counsels to make sure we’re being smart about our open source strategy, including enhancing our contributing guidelines and licensing posture to maximize our ability to assist our customer developers.
* Make lists shorter than this one, where possible

## Location
We will be opportunistic and hire for capability rather than by geography; however, given this is the first position on the team, a candidate will likely find greatest success being located in Seattle or San Jose (Bay Area), with a strong preference for Seattle. 
This is so that you can have both face to face interaction with developers as well as be in the same time zone as a good portion of the development organization, which includes both engineering management and product management. 
That said, a successful candidate will help us pave the road for a global team with coverage across the US and key geographies including Amsterdam, Bangalore, Pune, Shanghai, Tel Aviv, and Sydney, so this requirement will rapidly loosen up for the entire team.

## Travel
* Attend both local and non-local community events. Part of building this team is deciding where we need to support developers, so we'll be collectively defining what conferences need attending support the mission
* We think going to outside events (both conference and other community events) will eventually be ~20-30% of your time, with some internal travel on top of that. In the early days, travel will likely around coming up to speed with internal product teams, when a face to face visit is warranted.
* Being located in Seattle or San Jose will really help damper down internal travel.

## Qualifications
* Embody the Founders Mentality. See https://youtu.be/Rp4RCIfX66I for extra credit.
* Backgrounds in software development, including architecture, design, implementation, testing, and debugging, preferably by either contribution to or maintenance of Open Source projects. 
* Our products are written in a wide variety of languages, including C#, python, Go, server side Java, .NET Core, experience in one would be great, and more is even better.
* Our products expose REST APIs, experience with OpenAPI or other framework driven approaches would be great.
* Our products expose HTML5 interfaces, any experience with front-end web development and UX/UI design is welcomed.
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills with the ability to present complex technical information to all walks of technical and non-technical people.
* Experience in technical support, ideally in developer support.
* Embraces working with remote teams in different geographies, time zones, cultures, and skill levels.

## Credits
Thank you to those who have made their experiences public and whose work has inspiried us to start this practice. Given we're just getting started with this practices, we've borrowed some of the content and ideals from various Developer Advocacy practices from Microsoft, Google, and Rackspace to get the boat pointed in the right direction. We've distilled this down with our own flavoring, and will refine more from here.
